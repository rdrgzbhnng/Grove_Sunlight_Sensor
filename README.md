# Grove - Sunlight Sensor Patch  

The [Grove - Sunlight Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Sunlight-Sensor-p-2530.html) is a multi-channel digital light sensor, which has the ability to detect UV-light, visible light and infrared light.

The problem is that despite the new Si1550 lib working fine on an Arduino UNO, it appears it wasn't working on a SAMD21 MKR WiFi 1010 board.

For more information please visit [Arduino FORUM](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/si115x-not-running-on-mkr-wifi-1010/1051508).

For further testing, I'll use this patch as long as Seeed Studio or someone else doesn't fix the official library.
